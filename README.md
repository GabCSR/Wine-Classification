- Red Wine Classificator is a Machine Learning model using Random Forest Classificator library from scikit-learn that using the attributes given for each red wine tries to predict its evaluation. The model obtained 70+ % accuracy into predicting evaluations that range from 4-7.
- White Wine Classificator is a equivalent Machine Learning model that evaluates white wine instead of red wine. It achieves around 65% accuracy predicting the evaluation given by specialists.
